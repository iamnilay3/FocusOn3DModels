Math library, common throughout all demos.

This code helps you with many math problems in 3-D programming. It contains classes, including functions and many overloaded operators for Vectors, Matrices, and Quaternions. 

Feel free to use this code for your own projects, but be sure to credit and I'd appreciate an e-mail to let me know who is using my code for what, I am always interested in others projects. I would also be interested to know about any improvements you make to the code.

Files:
math.h - This is the file you include into your own code. It will give you quaternion, matrix, and vector functionality.
vector.inl/vector.h - Classes for both 2-D and 3-D vectors complete with overloaded operators, constructors and many functions such as dot and cross products.
matrix.inl/matrix.h - Classes for 3x3 and 4x4 matrices. These classes also have many overloaded operators, as well as functions for building transformation matrices and other matrix operations.
quaternion.inl/quaternion.h Class for quaternions. Contains all overloaded oeprators, manipulation functions, many conversion functions such as Euler->Quat and Matrix->Quat conversion as well as interpolation functions (SLERP and LERP).
