Model Description:
It's a chicken, a plucked naked chicken, a chick with no clothes goose pimples and a silly expression. But then it's a very silly chicken. It's mean and fearless and foul bird but a little stupid (well at least the bot is). If you are a serious quake player it might not be for you. I don't think many SERIOUS quake players really want to be a chicken? But hell, maybe they want the target practice on the bot! Me I want to be that chicken. Its the first Quake 3 plugin player model that I have completed entirely on my own and the first time I have animated using 3D Studio Max or Character studio. There are loads of things I would have liked to change in the animation, but I had to stop there, it was a bit much for my first time. I hope you get a laugh out of it anyway.

Thanks to: Caro for making me do it (It's dedicated to you babe), Tobias I hope you firgive me for teaching you to blow up your dad, Orianne for keeping me on my toes, Shithead, monster, Player, doc rob, tone and Scott Ruggels for their technical advice and of course all at polycount.
