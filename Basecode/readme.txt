Standard Basecode for all demos

This basecode handles all window creation and other basic functions including fonts, timing, image loading, and error logging. 

Feel free to use this basecode for your own projects, but be sure to credit and I'd appreciate an e-mail to let me know who is using my code for what, I am always interested in others projects.
