Skeletal1
This is a little demonstration of how skeletal animation works. The user can manipulate 1 of four joints and observ how other are affected.

Files:
Skeletal1.cpp/.h Main skeletal animation files. Everything for manipulating and displaying the skeleton can be found here.
Main.cpp - Main file, contains WinMain and global Init, Main Loop, and Shutdown functions.
Obj.dsp/Obj.dsw Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 project files.

Controls:

Click on the radio buttons at the top of the control box on the left side of the screen to select one of the four joints.
The six editboxes below the radio buttons allow you to enter the X,Y,Z rotation and the X,Y,Z translation values for the selected joint.
Below that the transformation matrix, the rotation quaternion, and the parent joint's ID are all displayed so that you can see how each changes as you select different joints and change the transformation values.
