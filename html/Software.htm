  for Evaluation Version Users</font><font color="#00FF33" face="Haettenschweiler">:<br>
  Please note that the Evaluation and ESD installations work differently than 
  the installer used on the Paint Shop Pro 7.01 CD-ROM. These versions extract 
  the files required to install Paint Shop Pro and Animation Shop to a user-defined 
  location on the user's hard drive, then begin the installation. The extracted 
  files are not removed from the user-defined location after the installation 
  is finished because they are required if you ever wish to modify your current 
  installation (e.g., add or remove components such as Picture Tubes or sample 
  animations using the &quot;Modify&quot; option in the program installation).</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF33" face="Haettenschweiler"> Because of this difference, 
  these versions require additional hard drive space (to store the downloaded 
  file, the extracted setup files, and the installed program). If you wish to 
  reclaim this disk space, perform the following task: </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#00FF33" face="Haettenschweiler"> 1. Note the location where 
    the installation files have been extracted. These files will be extracted 
    to the C:\Program Files\Jasc Software Inc\Setup Files\ folder by default. 
    You may then delete these files. If these files are deleted you will be unable 
    to modify your installation without running the downloaded Evaluation or ESD 
    installer again. We recommend performing this step only if you do not intend 
    to modify your installation. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#00FF33" face="Haettenschweiler"> Modifying a Paint Shop Pro or 
  Animation Shop Installation After Removing Extracted Files<br>
  If you deleted the extracted installation files as described in step 2 above 
  and you wish to modify your installation, re-run the downloaded Evaluation or 
  ESD installation files from your archive disk, and select the &quot;Modify&quot; 
  option offered during the installation.</font><br>

<p><font color="#00FF33"> 3D Canvas is a real-time 3D modeling and animation tool 
  that incorporates an intuitive drag-and-drop approach to 3D modeling.<br>
  <br>
  Complex models can be constructed from simple 3D primitives, or created using 
  3D Canvas' Object Building Tools. Modeling tools are provided to deform, sculpt, 
  and paint 3D objects.<br>
  <br>
  Creating an animated scene is as simple as positioning the objects within your 
  scene for each point in time in your animation. 3D Canvas will ensure that the 
  resulting animation runs smoothly. Your animation can be stepped through a frame 
  at a time, viewed in real-time, or recorded to a Video (AVI) file so that you 
  can distribute your creation.<br>
  <br>
  Tool roll-up groups allow you to customize the 3D Canvas interface so that only 
  those items you use most frequently are visible. And if you need access to a 
  less frequently used feature, the tool roll-up is always one click away.<br>
  <br>
  The standard version of 3D Canvas is a fully functional product provided as 
  freeware. Upgrades are available for those who require additional features either 
  for game development or for rendering photo-realistic images. </font></p>

<p><font color="#00FF33" face="Haettenschweiler">Anim8or is a 3D modeling and 
  character animation program that I have written over the past couple of years, 
  not as a commercial endeavor, but because I love 3D graphics, animation, and 
  programming. While it is far from a complete professional level application 
  like 3DStudio MAX or Lightwave, I believe that it has enough capability to be 
  of use to others.<br>
  <br> 
As Anim8or continues to grow, so does the number of users with over 70,000 downloads of v0.7!  Never in my wildest dreams would I have 
guessed that there would be this kind of interest.  There is still much left to do, both adding new capabilities to Anim8or and more and 
better support on the web site.  I can't possibly do everything that I'd like to.  Let me know what's important to you, and stick around 
to see Anim8or evolve!</font></p>

During the development, many file formats have been added.<br><br>
MilkShape 3D has all basic operations like select, move, rotate, scale, extrude, turn edge, subdivide, just to mention a few. 
MilkShape 3D also allows low-level editing with the vertex and face tool. Primitives like spheres, boxes and cylinders are also 
available.<br><br>
MilkShape 3D has also skeletal animation capabilities. This allows to export to morph target animation like the ones in the Quake 
model formats or to export to skeletal animations like Half-Life or Genesis3d.<br><br>
MilkShape 3D currently supports 37 different file formats from 27 different games/ engines/programs.
