OBJ

This demo loads and renders an OBJ file. Obj files do not store the name of textures, but they may contain texture coordinates. This particular model I rendered in wireframe because it has no texture of its own.
Obj files are generally exported by Alias|Wavefront's Maya (http://www.aliaswavefront.com).

Files:
Model.h - Basic model file, holds virtual class declarations.
Obj.h - Obj header file. Contains all declarations specific to Obj models
Obj.cpp - Main Obj file. Contains impementation for all Obj related functions.
Main.cpp - Main file, contains WinMain and global Init, Main Loop, and Shutdown functions.
Obj.dsp/Obj.dsw Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 project files.

Controls:
None
